## Do not use the RC2 symmetric block cipher.

### Summary

The RC2 symmetric block cipher should not be used without careful review.

### Details

The [RC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC2) algorithm is a relatively old
symmetric block cipher that is vulnerable to a related-key attack with 2^34
chosen plaintexts. In addition, as a 64-bit block cipher, it is unsuitable for
encrypting more than about 30 GB with a single key. There could also

In general, use of RC2 could be replaced with AES.

### Severity Considerations

All use of RC2 should be carefully reviewed to ensure both the implementation
and the usage context is secure.
