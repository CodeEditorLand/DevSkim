## Review Calls to PowerShell's Set-ExecutionPolicy

### Summary

Ensure that all calls to `Set-ExecutionPolicy` are reviewed to ensure they don't
inappropriately weaken the permissions available to untrusted PowerShell
scripts.

### Details

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` commandlet can be used to dynamically change the
permissions available to a PowerShell script. In a locked-down environment, the
policy should either be `Restricted` or `AllSigned`, or possibly `RemoteSigned`.
Setting the policy to `Unrestricted` or `Bypass` allows PowerShell to run any
script passed to it, potentially including malware.

### Severity Considerations

Setting an execution policy temporarily or in an environment where only trusted
scripts are run would be relatively low risk.
